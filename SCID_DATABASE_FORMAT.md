# SCID Database Format Documentation

**SCID (Shane's Chess Information Database)** uses a highly optimized proprietary binary format consisting of three files that work together to store chess games and associated metadata efficiently. This format was designed by Shane Hudson to minimize storage space while maintaining fast access to game metadata.

## Overview

A SCID database consists of three files with the same base name but different extensions:

- **`.si4`** - Index file (game metadata and fast search data)
- **`.sn4`** - Name file (player names, events, sites, rounds with compression)
- **`.sg4`** - Game file (actual chess moves, variations, comments in binary format)

### Why Three Files?

This separation allows SCID to:
1. **Fast searching**: Read only the index file for metadata queries
2. **Memory efficiency**: Load only needed components  
3. **Compressed storage**: Each file uses optimal compression for its data type
4. **Parallel access**: Multiple processes can read different components

## File Format Details

### 1. Index File (.si4)

The index file contains a header followed by fixed-size entries for each game.

#### Index Header (182 bytes total)

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0-7 | 8 bytes | Magic | "Scid.si\0" (identifier string) |
| 8-9 | 2 bytes | Version | SCID version number (big-endian) |
| 10-13 | 4 bytes | BaseType | Database type identifier (big-endian) |
| 14-16 | 3 bytes | NumGames | Number of games (big-endian, 24-bit) |
| 17-19 | 3 bytes | AutoLoad | Auto-load game number (big-endian, 24-bit) |
| 20-127 | 108 bytes | Description | Database description string |
| 128-181 | 54 bytes | CustomFlags | 6 custom flag descriptions (9 bytes each) |

#### Game Index Entry (47 bytes each)

Each game has a 47-byte index entry with the following structure:

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0-3 | 4 bytes | Offset | Position in .sg4 file |
| 4-5 | 2 bytes | Length_Low | Game data length (low 16 bits) |
| 6 | 1 byte | Length_High | Game data length (high bit) + custom flags |
| 7-8 | 2 bytes | Flags | Various game flags |
| 9 | 1 byte | WhiteBlack_High | High bits of White/Black player IDs |
| 10-11 | 2 bytes | WhiteID_Low | White player ID (low 16 bits) |
| 12-13 | 2 bytes | BlackID_Low | Black player ID (low 16 bits) |
| 14 | 1 byte | EventSiteRnd_High | High bits of Event/Site/Round IDs |
| 15-16 | 2 bytes | EventID_Low | Event ID (low 16 bits) |
| 17-18 | 2 bytes | SiteID_Low | Site ID (low 16 bits) |
| 19-20 | 2 bytes | RoundID_Low | Round ID (low 16 bits) |
| 21-22 | 2 bytes | VarCounts | Variation/comment/NAG counts + result |
| 23-24 | 2 bytes | EcoCode | ECO opening code |
| **25-28** | **4 bytes** | **Dates** | **Game date + event date (packed)** |
| 29-30 | 2 bytes | WhiteElo | White player rating |
| 31-32 | 2 bytes | BlackElo | Black player rating |
| 33-36 | 4 bytes | FinalMatSig | Final position material signature |
| 37 | 1 byte | NumHalfMoves | Number of half-moves (low 8 bits) |
| 38-46 | 9 bytes | HomePawnData | Pawn structure data + high move bits |

#### Date Field Format (Critical!)

The **Dates field at offset 25-28** is a 32-bit value that contains **BOTH** game date and event date using clever bit packing:

```
Bits 31-20: EventDate (12 bits, relative encoding - see below)
Bits 19-0:  GameDate (20 bits, absolute encoding)
```

## Game Date vs Event Date

**Game Date**: The specific date when this individual game was played  
**Event Date**: The start date of the tournament/match/event containing this game

**Example**: In the 2023 Candidates Tournament:
- **Event Date**: April 9, 2023 (tournament start)
- **Game Dates**: April 10, April 12, April 14, etc. (individual games)

### Game Date Encoding (20 bits)

Game dates use absolute encoding with no offsets:

```
DATE_MAKE(year, month, day) = ((year << 9) | (month << 5) | day)

Bits 0-4:   Day (1-31)     - 5 bits
Bits 5-8:   Month (1-12)   - 4 bits  
Bits 9-19:  Year           - 11 bits (supports years 0-2047)
```

**Important**: Years are stored directly with NO offset. A year of 2022 is stored as 2022.

**Example**: 
- Date: 2022.12.19
- Encoded: `((2022 << 9) | (12 << 5) | 19) = 0x000FCD93`

### Event Date Encoding (12 bits) - Advanced Topic

Event dates use **relative encoding** to save space. The event year is stored as a 3-bit offset relative to the game year:

```
EventDate structure (12 bits total):
Bits 0-4:   Day (1-31)     - 5 bits
Bits 5-8:   Month (1-12)   - 4 bits  
Bits 9-11:  Year Offset    - 3 bits (represents game_year + offset - 4)
```

**Year Offset Calculation**:
- Valid range: Event year must be within ±3 years of game year
- If event year is outside this range, entire event date field is set to 0 (no event date)
- Stored offset = `(event_year - game_year + 4) & 7`
- Decoded year = `game_year + stored_offset - 4`
- Special case: offset value 0 means "no event date" (different from year offset of -4)

**Why ±3 Years?**
The 3-bit year offset field can store values 0-7:
- Value 0: Reserved for "no event date"
- Values 1-7: Represent year offsets of -3 to +3 relative to game year
- Offset mapping: `stored_value = actual_offset + 4`
- Example: event year = game year + 2 → stored value = 2 + 4 = 6

**Why Relative Encoding?**
- Tournament games are typically played within days/weeks of event start
- Match games might span a few months
- ±3 year range covers 99% of real-world scenarios
- Saves 8 bits compared to absolute encoding

**Example**: 
- Game Date: 2020.06.15, Event Date: 2022.12.19
- Year offset: `(2022 - 2020 + 4) & 7 = 6`
- Event encoded: `(6 << 9) | (12 << 5) | 19 = 0xD93`
- Full field: `0xD93FC8CF` (upper 12 bits for event, lower 20 for game)

**Practical Implementation**:

```rust
// Extract both dates from Dates field
let dates_field = u32::from_le_bytes([bytes[25], bytes[26], bytes[27], bytes[28]]);

// Game date (lower 20 bits) - simple extraction
let game_date = dates_field & 0x000FFFFF;
let game_day = (game_date & 31) as u8;
let game_month = ((game_date >> 5) & 15) as u8;  
let game_year = ((game_date >> 9) & 0x7FF) as u16;

// Event date (upper 12 bits) - relative decoding
let event_data = (dates_field >> 20) & 0xFFF;
if event_data != 0 {  // Check if event date is set
    let event_day = (event_data & 31) as u8;
    let event_month = ((event_data >> 5) & 15) as u8;
    let year_offset = ((event_data >> 9) & 7) as u16;
    
    if year_offset != 0 {  // year_offset=0 means no event date
        let event_year = game_year + year_offset - 4;
        println!("Event: {}.{:02}.{:02}", event_year, event_month, event_day);
    }
}
```

#### Name ID Encoding

Player, event, site, and round IDs are stored as packed values to save space. SCID supports up to ~1 million names of each type.

**White/Black Player IDs (20 bits each)**:
```
WhiteID = ((WhiteBlack_High & 0xF0) << 12) | WhiteID_Low
BlackID = ((WhiteBlack_High & 0x0F) << 16) | BlackID_Low
```

**Event/Site/Round IDs**:
```
EventID = ((EventSiteRnd_High & 0xE0) << 11) | EventID_Low  (19 bits)
SiteID = ((EventSiteRnd_High & 0x1C) << 14) | SiteID_Low    (19 bits)
RoundID = ((EventSiteRnd_High & 0x03) << 16) | RoundID_Low  (18 bits)
```

**Bit Allocation in High Bytes**:
- `WhiteBlack_High`: 4 bits white + 4 bits black
- `EventSiteRnd_High`: 3 bits event + 3 bits site + 2 bits round

### Additional Index Fields

**VarCounts Field (2 bytes)**:
```
Bits 15-12: Result (4 bits) - 0=None, 1=White wins, 2=Black wins, 3=Draw
Bits 11-8:  NAG count (4 bits) - Number of annotation symbols
Bits 7-4:   Comment count (4 bits) - Number of text comments  
Bits 3-0:   Variation count (4 bits) - Number of alternative lines
```

**ELO Ratings (2 bytes each)**:
```
Bits 15-12: Rating type (4 bits) - Elo, FIDE, etc.
Bits 11-0:  Rating value (12 bits) - Max 4095, 0=unrated
```

**Flags Field (2 bytes)**:
Common flags include:
- Bit 0: Custom starting position
- Bit 1: Contains promotions  
- Bit 3: Marked for deletion
- Bit 4: White openings flag
- Bit 5: Black openings flag
- Additional bits for tactical themes, endgames, etc.

**NumHalfMoves Encoding**:
- Low 8 bits stored in NumHalfMoves field (offset 37)
- High 2 bits stored in HomePawnData[0] >> 6 (offset 38, top 2 bits)
- Total range: 0-1023 half-moves
- Formula: `total_moves = NumHalfMoves | ((HomePawnData[0] >> 6) << 8)`

### 2. Name File (.sn4)

The name file stores all text strings (player names, events, sites, rounds) using sophisticated front-coded compression to minimize storage space.

#### Name Header (36 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0-7 | 8 bytes | Magic | "Scid.sn\0" |
| 8-11 | 4 bytes | TimeStamp | File creation/modification timestamp |
| 12-14 | 3 bytes | NumPlayers | Number of player names |
| 15-17 | 3 bytes | NumEvents | Number of event names |
| 18-20 | 3 bytes | NumSites | Number of site names |
| 21-23 | 3 bytes | NumRounds | Number of round names |
| 24-26 | 3 bytes | MaxFreqPlayers | Maximum frequency count for players |
| 27-29 | 3 bytes | MaxFreqEvents | Maximum frequency count for events |
| 30-32 | 3 bytes | MaxFreqSites | Maximum frequency count for sites |
| 33-35 | 3 bytes | MaxFreqRounds | Maximum frequency count for rounds |

#### Name Storage Format

Names are stored with **front-coding compression** where common prefixes are shared between consecutive entries. This is extremely effective for chess databases where many player names share prefixes.

**Front-Coding Example**:
```
Original names:    Storage:
"Smith, John"   →  [0, 11, "Smith, John"]     (prefix=0, "Smith, John")
"Smith, Jane"   →  [7, 4, "Jane"]             (prefix=7, "Jane") 
"Smith, Bob"    →  [7, 3, "Bob"]              (prefix=7, "Bob")
"Jones, Mary"   →  [0, 11, "Jones, Mary"]     (prefix=0, "Jones, Mary")
```

Each name entry contains:
1. **Prefix length** (variable-length integer) - How many characters to reuse
2. **Suffix length** (variable-length integer) - Length of new characters  
3. **Suffix data** (UTF-8 bytes) - The new characters to append

**Variable-Length Integer Encoding**:
SCID uses a compact encoding for small integers:
- Values 0-127: Single byte (bit 7 = 0)
- Values 128+: Multiple bytes (bit 7 = 1 in continuation bytes)

**Name Sections**:
The file contains four sections in order:
1. Player names (sorted alphabetically)
2. Event names (sorted alphabetically) 
3. Site names (sorted alphabetically)
4. Round names (sorted alphabetically)

**Text Encoding**:
- UTF-8 encoding for international characters
- Control characters (0x00-0x1F) are filtered out
- Leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed

### 3. Game File (.sg4)

The game file contains the actual chess moves, variations, and comments in a highly compressed binary format optimized for space and parsing speed.

#### Game Data Structure

Each game's data includes:
- **Move encoding**: Moves stored in compact binary format (2-3 bytes per move typically)
- **Variations**: Tree structure for alternative move sequences  
- **Comments**: Compressed text annotations
- **NAGs**: Numeric Annotation Glyphs (!, ?, !!!, etc.)
- **Starting position**: If different from standard chess starting position

#### Move Encoding

SCID uses a sophisticated move encoding that exploits chess move patterns:

**Standard Moves** (most common):
- From/to squares encoded in 6 bits each (64 squares = 6 bits)
- Piece type inferred from board position
- Special handling for castling, en passant, promotion

**Compressed Encoding**:
- Common moves (e4, d4, Nf3, etc.) get shorter encodings
- Piece movements encoded relative to piece positions
- Captures and checks use flag bits

**Variable-Length Encoding**:
- Frequent moves: 1-2 bytes
- Regular moves: 2-3 bytes  
- Unusual moves: 3+ bytes

#### Variation Tree Structure

SCID stores variations as a tree structure:
```
Main line: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5
  ├─ 2...Nf6 (alternative)
  └─ 3.Bc4 (alternative)
     └─ 3...f5!? (sub-variation)
```

**Variation Markers**:
- Start variation: Special byte marker
- End variation: Return to parent line
- Nested depth: Up to 127 levels supported

#### Comment Storage

Text comments are stored with compression:
- **Dictionary compression**: Common chess terms pre-encoded
- **UTF-8 support**: International characters supported
- **Formatting preserved**: Paragraph breaks, emphasis maintained

#### NAG (Numeric Annotation Glyphs)

Standard chess annotation symbols:
```
1-6: !, ?, !!, ??, !?, ?!
7-18: Various positional evaluations  
19+: Extended annotations (space advantage, time pressure, etc.)
```

NAGs are stored as single bytes following the move they annotate.

## Reading Process

To read a SCID database systematically:

### 1. Parse Index File (.si4)
```rust
// Read header
let header = parse_si4_header(file);
println!("Database contains {} games", header.num_games);

// Read each game index entry (47 bytes each)
for i in 0..header.num_games {
    let entry = read_game_index_entry(file);
    
    // Extract game date (lower 20 bits)
    let game_date = entry.dates_field & 0x000FFFFF;
    let day = (game_date & 31) as u8;
    let month = ((game_date >> 5) & 15) as u8;
    let year = ((game_date >> 9) & 0x7FF) as u16;
    
    // Extract event date (upper 12 bits) if present
    let event_data = (entry.dates_field >> 20) & 0xFFF;
    if event_data != 0 {
        let event_day = (event_data & 31) as u8;
        let event_month = ((event_data >> 5) & 15) as u8;
        let year_offset = ((event_data >> 9) & 7) as u16;
        if year_offset != 0 {
            let event_year = year + year_offset - 4;
            // Use event date...
        }
    }
    
    // Extract name IDs
    let white_id = ((entry.white_black_high & 0xF0) << 12) | entry.white_id_low;
    let black_id = ((entry.white_black_high & 0x0F) << 16) | entry.black_id_low;
    // etc.
}
```

### 2. Parse Name File (.sn4)
```rust
let name_file = open_sn4_file();
let name_header = parse_sn4_header(name_file);

// Read player names with front-coding
let mut player_names = Vec::new();
let mut current_prefix = String::new();

for i in 0..name_header.num_players {
    let prefix_len = read_varint(name_file);
    let suffix_len = read_varint(name_file);
    let suffix_bytes = read_bytes(name_file, suffix_len);
    
    // Construct full name
    current_prefix.truncate(prefix_len);
    current_prefix.push_str(&String::from_utf8(suffix_bytes)?);
    player_names.push(current_prefix.clone());
}
```

### 3. Parse Game File (.sg4) - If Needed
```rust
// Seek to game position using offset from index
let game_offset = index_entry.offset;
game_file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(game_offset))?;

// Parse moves, variations, comments
let game_data = parse_sg4_game(game_file, index_entry.length);
```

### 4. Combine Data
```rust
// Resolve name IDs to actual names
let white_name = &player_names[white_id as usize];
let black_name = &player_names[black_id as usize];
let event_name = &event_names[event_id as usize];

// Convert to PGN or other format
println!("[White \"{}\"]\n[Black \"{}\"]\n[Event \"{}\"]", 
         white_name, black_name, event_name);
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Date Parsing Issues

The most common bug in SCID parsers is incorrect date handling. Here are the critical points:

❌ **Common Mistakes**:
- Searching for specific date patterns in binary data
- Using hardcoded year offsets like +1408 or -1900  
- Reading dates from variable positions
- Ignoring the event date in upper 12 bits
- Not handling the relative year encoding for event dates

✅ **Correct Approach**:
- Always read Dates field from fixed offset 25-28 in index entry
- Extract game date from lower 20 bits using bit masks
- Extract event date from upper 12 bits with relative year decoding
- Use the exact bit field definitions from SCID source code
- Handle edge cases (no event date, year out of range)

### Critical Date Implementation

```rust
fn parse_dates_field(dates_field: u32) -> (GameDate, Option<EventDate>) {
    // Game date (lower 20 bits) - absolute encoding
    let game_date_raw = dates_field & 0x000FFFFF;
    let game_date = GameDate {
        day: (game_date_raw & 31) as u8,
        month: ((game_date_raw >> 5) & 15) as u8,
        year: ((game_date_raw >> 9) & 0x7FF) as u16,
    };
    
    // Event date (upper 12 bits) - relative encoding
    let event_data = (dates_field >> 20) & 0xFFF;
    let event_date = if event_data == 0 {
        None  // No event date set
    } else {
        let day = (event_data & 31) as u8;
        let month = ((event_data >> 5) & 15) as u8;
        let year_offset = ((event_data >> 9) & 7) as u16;
        
        if year_offset == 0 {
            None  // Invalid year offset
        } else {
            let year = game_date.year + year_offset - 4;
            Some(EventDate { day, month, year })
        }
    };
    
    (game_date, event_date)
}
```

### Endianness and Byte Order

**🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION**: All multi-byte values in SCID files are stored in **BIG-ENDIAN** format (not little-endian as previously documented). This has been verified through systematic experimentation and cross-validation against SCID source code.

**Affected Fields** (ALL numeric multi-byte fields):
- All integer fields in headers (version, game counts, etc.)
- All packed ID fields in index entries  
- **The critical Dates field containing game and event dates**
- ELO ratings and other numeric values
- Game offsets and lengths
- Flag fields and result codes

**Example**: A 32-bit value `0x12345678` is stored as bytes `[0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78]`

**Correct Implementation**:
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT - Use big-endian conversion for ALL SCID multi-byte values
let version = u16::from_be_bytes([bytes[0], bytes[1]]);
let dates_field = u32::from_be_bytes([bytes[25], bytes[26], bytes[27], bytes[28]]);
let player_id = u16::from_be_bytes([bytes[10], bytes[11]]);
```

**Source Code Verification**: This matches SCID's `mfile.cpp` implementation:
- `ReadTwoBytes()`: Reads high byte first, then low byte (big-endian)
- `ReadFourBytes()`: Reads bytes in big-endian order
- All SCID numeric fields follow this pattern

**Historical Note**: Previous documentation incorrectly assumed little-endian format. This error was discovered through the `experiments/scid_parser/` systematic testing framework and corrected in August 2025.

### Error Handling and Validation

**File Validation**:
```rust
// Validate magic headers
assert_eq!(&header.magic, b"Scid.si\0");

// Check reasonable bounds
assert!(header.num_games < 50_000_000);  // Sanity check
assert!(game_date.year < 2048);          // 11-bit limit
assert!(game_date.month >= 1 && game_date.month <= 12);
assert!(game_date.day >= 1 && game_date.day <= 31);
```

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Handle truncated files (incomplete entries)
- Skip corrupted entries rather than failing completely
- Validate name ID references against actual name counts
- Provide default values for missing/invalid data

### Performance Considerations

**Memory Usage**:
- Index entries: 47 bytes × number of games (can be large!)
- Load names on-demand rather than all at once
- Use memory mapping for large index files

**I/O Optimization**:
- Read index entries in batches
- Cache frequently accessed name ranges
- Use async I/O for concurrent access to multiple files

### Name ID Limits

**Maximum Values**:
- Player IDs: 20 bits = 1,048,575 players max (2^20 - 1)
- Event IDs: 19 bits = 524,287 events max (2^19 - 1)
- Site IDs: 19 bits = 524,287 sites max (2^19 - 1)  
- Round IDs: 18 bits = 262,143 rounds max (2^18 - 1)
- ELO ratings: 12 bits = 4095 max, but SCID limits to 4000
- Games per database: ~16.7 million (24-bit game numbers)
- Year range: 0-2047 (11-bit years in date encoding)

These limits are sufficient for even the largest chess databases.

## Complete Example: Reading a SCID Database

Here's a complete example showing how to read game metadata from a SCID database:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Read, Seek, SeekFrom};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct GameMetadata {
    white_name: String,
    black_name: String,
    event_name: String,
    site_name: String,
    game_date: String,
    event_date: Option<String>,
    result: String,
    white_elo: u16,
    black_elo: u16,
}

fn read_scid_database(base_path: &str) -> Result<Vec<GameMetadata>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open all three files
    let mut index_file = File::open(format!("{}.si4", base_path))?;
    let mut name_file = File::open(format!("{}.sn4", base_path))?;
    
    // Read index header
    let mut header_bytes = [0u8; 182];
    index_file.read_exact(&mut header_bytes)?;
    
    // Validate magic and extract game count
    assert_eq!(&header_bytes[0..8], b"Scid.si\0");
    let num_games = u32::from_le_bytes([
        header_bytes[14], header_bytes[15], header_bytes[16], 0
    ]);
    
    // Read all names first (simplified - real implementation would use front-coding)
    let names = read_all_names(&mut name_file)?;
    
    let mut games = Vec::new();
    
    // Read each game index entry
    for _ in 0..num_games {
        let mut entry_bytes = [0u8; 47];
        index_file.read_exact(&mut entry_bytes)?;
        
        // Parse the index entry
        let game = parse_game_entry(&entry_bytes, &names)?;
        games.push(game);
    }
    
    Ok(games)
}

fn parse_game_entry(bytes: &[u8], names: &Names) -> Result<GameMetadata, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Extract name IDs
    let white_black_high = bytes[9];
    let white_id = ((white_black_high & 0xF0) as u32) << 12 | 
                   u16::from_le_bytes([bytes[10], bytes[11]]) as u32;
    let black_id = ((white_black_high & 0x0F) as u32) << 16 | 
                   u16::from_le_bytes([bytes[12], bytes[13]]) as u32;
    
    let event_site_rnd_high = bytes[14];
    let event_id = ((event_site_rnd_high & 0xE0) as u32) << 11 | 
                   u16::from_le_bytes([bytes[15], bytes[16]]) as u32;

## Testing Your Implementation

To verify your SCID parser is working correctly:

1. **Date Validation**: 
   - Create test cases with known dates
   - Verify both game and event dates decode correctly
   - Test edge cases (no event date, year boundaries)

2. **Name Resolution**:
   - Check that name IDs resolve to expected strings
   - Verify front-coding decompression works
   - Test unicode/international character handling

3. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Compare your output with official SCID tools
   - Export same database to PGN using SCID and compare
   - Verify game counts, date ranges, name frequencies

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large databases (1M+ games)
   - Monitor memory usage during parsing
   - Benchmark parsing speed vs file size

## Verification Methodology

This documentation has been verified through systematic reverse engineering using the **Experiments Framework**:

### Experiments Framework (August 2025)
**Location**: `experiments/scid_parser/` - Complete test harness for binary format understanding

**Methodology**:
1. **Iterative Field Analysis**: Parse each field individually with comprehensive debug output
2. **Cross-Validation**: Compare every implementation against SCID source code methods
3. **Small, Incremental Changes**: Build understanding field-by-field with thorough testing
4. **Big-Endian Discovery**: Systematic testing revealed true byte order through version/count field analysis

**Key Discoveries**:
- **Endianness**: All SCID multi-byte values use big-endian (verified via `mfile.cpp`)
- **Date Location**: Fixed offset 25-28 in 47-byte game index (not variable position)  
- **Date Format**: Lower 20 bits = game date, upper 12 bits = event date (relative encoding)
- **ID Packing**: Player IDs (20-bit), Event/Site IDs (19-bit), Round IDs (18-bit)
- **Bit Field Extraction**: Precise bit manipulation for flags, results, ELO ratings

**Validation Results**:
- Version: 400 ✅ (was showing 36865 with little-endian)
- Game Count: 5 ✅ (was showing 327680 with little-endian)  
- Date: "2022.12.19" ✅ (successfully extracted from `test/data/five.si4`)
- Player IDs: White=0, Black=1 ✅ (correctly parsed from packed format)
- Result: 3 → "1/2-1/2" ✅ (draw result correctly decoded)

### Cross-Reference Implementation
**Complete Working Parser**: `experiments/scid_parser/src/si4.rs`
- All 47-byte index fields successfully parsed
- Every field implementation validated against SCID source methods
- Comprehensive debug output for field-by-field verification
- Proven methodology for binary format reverse engineering
